- Huge win on JVM because slow startup time
- Not the same as other console (explain why e.g. programs different (see stu scisors talk)
- Explain basic clojure needed
- Give on example (maybe amp's geo)
- show test using transcriptor (but tell it works with other framework)
- If have more time, use clojure spec's excercise to gen example


- Most of the time works start with
  - see what data you have
  - read old code
  - learn how to use library
  - learn how to use framework
